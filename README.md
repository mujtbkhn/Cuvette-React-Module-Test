# Pocket Notes - [live](https://mujtaba-cuvette-react-test.netlify.app/)

- This a React Module test given by Cuvette for testing our skills in frontend
- we need to create an application which can create groups and also have notes for the particular groups 
- all the notes should be retreived on reload/refresh 
- should be mobile responsive 

 INPUT VALIDATIONS && ERROR HANDLING
- user should write groupName to proceed
- user should pick a color to proceed
- if either is not selected they get user friendly error
- additionally a recommended set length is also given for the groupName

### This was very good project to test our frontend knowledge
